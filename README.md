# Movie Recommendation System

Content-based movie recommendation system using Python.

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using Python.

## Overview
The system recommends movies based on similarity of content features such as genres, keywords, and descriptions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using vectorization techniques
- Similarity computation using cosine similarity

## Outcome
The system generates personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity-based recommendation techniques using real-world datasets.
